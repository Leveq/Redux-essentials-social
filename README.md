# Redux Essentials Tutorial Example 
### The Redux Essentials tutorial is a "top-down" tutorial that teaches "how to use Redux the right way", using our latest recommended APIs and best practices.

## [See the example here](https://reduxessentials.netlify.app)

This project contains the setup and code from the "Redux Essentials" tutorial in the Redux docs ( https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts ).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

> **Note**: If you are using Node 17, this project may not start correctly due to a known issue with Webpack and Node's OpenSSL changes, which causes an error message containing `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`.  
> You can work around this by setting a `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` environment variable before starting the dev server.
